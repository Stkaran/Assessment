# Assessment

For our final project's goal was to be able to predict a NBA player's ranking based off their stats and then would compare this to a NBA2k game rankings to judge the accuracy of our model.
We ended up using a RandomForestClassifier model, used Postgres for the database, and html and javascript to display the processed data.
The data was spilt up to use the 19-20 season as the testing data and the 14-18 seasons as the training data. 
For me, the html and javascript modules gave me the most trouble in the course so I wanted to focus on it for the final project to try and boost my confidence for it.
For the most part, I was pleased with what I was able to accomplish with it. The only other thing I would've like to tackle was being able to display graphs with js that would change with each player selection.

As far as the group members, they were all awesome and very easy to work with.I was very nervous abouth the final project, but the culture of our group made it very easy to work in and was far less stressful than I thought it was gonna be.
Everyone contributed evenly and were helpful when giving constructive feedback on how to improve our work.

As far as myself, I think this course has laid a good foundation with coding especially when it comes to python, however there is still a lack of confidence that I'm struggling with.
I think the only to get over this though is apply for jobs in the industry as that is the only way I'll get the practice I need to get better at the variety of languages we use throughout the course.
